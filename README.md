# Py_Tic-Tac-Toe
A very basic 2-player implementation of the Tic-Tac-Toe game in Python.


On startup, the board will show a 3x3 grid numbered 1 through 9.
Use the number keys on the keyboard when prompted to replace that number with a player token.
First to get three tokens lined up in a row wins.
